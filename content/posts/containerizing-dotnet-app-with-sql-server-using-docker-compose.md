In this tutorial, we are going to containerize the¬†.NET Web API application with docker. I am assuming you are familiar with docker. At least, you should have some understandings of how docker works. However, I have covered all the steps needed to create a docker container for your application, but I am not going to cover the [theoretical concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29) of docker.

## Last updated on:

### üî®Tools needed

- Visual Studio Code (Free)
- .Net 9.0 SDK (Free)
- Docker desktop (Free)

### üßë‚ÄçüíªTech used

- .Net 9.0 Web APIs (controller APIs)
- Ms SQL Server 2022 (within a container)
- Docker compose

**üçµNote:** I am using windows 11 operating system. However, I also have tested it in the Linux mint xia and it is working fine.

### Why to chose docker¬†compose?

General workflow of creating images and container **without docker compose**:

![Without docker compose](/images/1_6-UxPoNDg8CaCrzcmX9KFA.png)

You have to create and run containers separately, which involves typing all the commands manually in the terminal or bash each time.

### With docker¬†compose

![with docker compose](/images/1_a5ctJIb01ezA3dFn-ivMFQ.png)

All the steps to build the images and create the containers are defined in a a single file called `compose.yaml`¬†. You just need to fire a single command to create and run multiple containers.

### Let‚Äôs start with pulling the Github¬†repo

To save time, I have already created the¬†.net application and you can pull the [Github repo](https://github.com/rd003/DotnetDockerDemo) to get the application.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rd003/DotnetDockerDemo.git
```

Open this application in the visual studio code and follow the steps.

### Creating a Dockerfile

First and foremost, create a file named **‚ÄòDockerfile‚Äô** in the root directory. Make sure, **Dockerfile** does not have any extension.

![docker file](/images/1_mbkxHtBmAEpcR6C2jB4_Iw.jpg)

Add the following content in the docker file.

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
WORKDIR /source

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY \*.sln .
COPY DotnetDockerDemo.Api/\*.csproj ./DotnetDockerDemo.Api/
RUN dotnet restore

# copy everything else and build app
COPY DotnetDockerDemo.Api/. ./DotnetDockerDemo.Api/
WORKDIR /source/DotnetDockerDemo.Api
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app

# final stage/image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0 AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "DotnetDockerDemo.Api.dll"]
```

This `Dockerfile` contains the instruction to create a docker image of our¬†.net application. It is needed to build a¬†.net application image, which will run in a container.

### Creating a compose.yaml file

Next, create a file name `compose.yaml` in the root directory and paste the following content there.

```yaml
services:
  server:
    container_name: people-apis
    build: .
    image: people-api:1.0.0
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
      - "sql"
  sql:
    image: "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest"
    container_name: sql_server
    ports:
      - 1433:1433
    environment:
      - ACCEPT_EULA=y
      - MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=p@55w0rd
    volumes:
      - sql-server-data:/var/opt/mssql

volumes:
  sql-server-data:
    name: sql-data
```

In this file, we have defined two services.

- First, it will build a docker image of¬†.net application named `people-api:1.0.0`  and create a container for it, which will listen on the port 8080.
- Second, it will pull the sql server image from the docker hub, create the container for it which will listen in the port 1433. The image will be pulled only once; if you already have a sql server image with similar tag, it won‚Äôt be pull again.

I have created volume in sql server section.

```yml
volumes:
  sql-server-data:
  name: sql-data
```

I have create a volume named `sql-server-data` and using this volume as follow

```yml
volumes:
  - sql-server-data: /var/opt/mssql
```

This line mounts `sql-server-data` volume to the path `/var/opt/mssql`¬†. **By creating volumes our data persists outside the container.** If we remove the container or recreate it, our data (database, tables, procedures‚Ä¶everything) will persist.

**Note:** The `dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` file is created at June,19,2025. The content present in **dockerfile** and **compose file** is valid as of now, but may not be valid if you are reading this blog post in distant future.

#### Update the appsettings.json

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
 "default": "Server=sql,1433;Database=DotnetDockerDemo;User Id=sa;Password=myStrong(!)Password;encrypt=false"
 }
```

You may have noticed, I have defined **‚Äòserver ‚Äô** as **‚Äòsql,1433‚Äô.** Here‚Äôs what it means:

- `sql` represents the name of service defined in `compose.yaml`. Look at the snippet below:

```txt
// compose.yaml

 sql:  <==== It is the name, I am refering in connection string
    image: "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest"
    container_name: sql_server
```

- `1433` is the **port of sql server** which is running in a container. We have defined this port in the`compose.yaml` file.

#### Run docker¬†compose

We need to run the following command

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

`-d` flag indicates that container is running in the `detached mode`. This command will execute the `compose.yaml` file and create the container for the¬†.net application and sql server.

As a result of the command, you should see something like this in your terminal.

![docker running](/images/1_8Wn4flup_4Up_uuL9D9mNg.jpg)

To verify if container is running or not, run the following command:

```sh
docker ps -a
```

As a result, you should see something like this in your terminal.

![docker ps -a](/images/1_di8iOe5GQWulFFmFkyUXNg.jpg)

However, you can also verify it in the docker desktop.

![docker desktop](/images/1_QKWWk-zKboLOGpqSKOS2hQ.jpg)

### Testing the application

To test the application, open a web browser and type the url `[http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast](http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast)`. As a result, you should see the following response in the browser.

![response1](/images/1_qKVhg2cNtjj26USci_lXeg.png)

This indicates that our application is working perfectly.

### Testing the endpoints using sql¬†server

Type the url `[http://localhost:8080/api/people/](http://localhost:8080/api/people/)` in the browser and as a result you might receive the person array.

## Removing composed containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

## üíª Code with Dockerfile and compose.yaml

I have created a separate branch which contains the dockerfile and `compose.yaml` file. To get the source code with these file, you need to checkout the branch container¬†.

**Url:** https://github.com/rd003/DotnetDockerDemo/tree/container

To get this branch along in your cloned project, you need to run `git checkout container`.
