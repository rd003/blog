**Abstraction** allows you to focus on the relevant details of an object while ignoring unnecessary complexities.  
This is achieved by defining a simplified representation of an object that **hides the implementation details and exposes only the necessary features**.  
In practical terms, **abstraction is implemented through abstract classes and interfaces in languages like C#**.

**ðŸ“ºOther OOPs related articlesÂ :**

- [Inheritance in C#](https://ravindradevrani.medium.com/inheritance-in-c-08327a9efee5)
- [Polymorphism in C#](https://medium.com/@ravindradevrani/polymorphism-in-c-ea312521d050)

Letâ€™s implement abstraction by using **interface**. In the real world projects, we use interfaces more often.

```cs
public interface ICar
{
 int Speed { get; set; }

    void Accelerate();

    void Brake();

    void Refuel();

}
```

ðŸ‘‰In this case, `ICar` is an `interface` with some features. A class, that implements this interface, will follow this blueprint. That class must have a property name `Speed` and the methods like `Accelerate(),Brake()` and `Refuel()`. These are the necessary details for any type of car, it does not matter if it is a sedan, SUV or a sports car. Every Car will have these features.

ðŸ‘‰ So we are declaring the **necessary features** like `Speed`, `Accelarate()`,`Break()` and `Refule()` and **hiding unnecessary complexities** like `implementation details` of these features.

Abstraction is like looking at these things from a high level without worrying about specific details. For example, you donâ€™t care about how the `Brake()` feature will work. You are saying that, hey there will be a `Break()` feature in the Car. How does `Break()` work? We donâ€™t care. It will be taken care later. Which will be shown in this example.

We are creating a class `Sedan`, which is implementing `ICar` interface. In this class, we are defining the `Accelarate(),Brake() and Refuel()` feature according to the sedan cars.

```cs
public class Sedan : ICar
{
 public int Speed { get; set; }

    public void Accelerate()
    {
        // Implementation for accelerating a sedan
    }

    public void Brake()
    {
        // Implementation for braking a sedan
    }

    public void Refuel()
    {
        // Implementation for refueling a sedan
    }

}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Similarly, create other **classes** like `SUV`, `SportsCar` etc.

ðŸ‘‰ That was all about abstraction you might have few doubts in mind, like why need to create an interface, then implement it in a class. We can directly create a class with all the needed features. If you have that doubt then move to the next section, otherwise you can skip it here.

## Why would I take extra steps to create the interface?

Now, you might be wondering that, why do we create an interface and implement it in a class. We can avoid the extra step of creating the interface and define all the methods in the class. As shown in the example below.

```cs
public class Sedan
{
 public int Speed { get; set; }

    public void Accelerate()
    {
        // Implementation for accelerating a sedan
    }

    public void Brake()
    {
        // Implementation for braking a sedan
    }

    public void Refuel()
    {
        // Implementation for refueling a sedan
    }

}
```

Here we are not using any interface and still achieving the same result. Letâ€™s see what are the benefits.

**1. Abstraction:** It helps to look things from high level without worrying about specific details. For exampleÂ , what are features you need in a car. Just the higher level overview and no need to worry about actual functionality.

**2. Code Consistency:** Using interfaces promotes consistency in your code. If you have multiple classes implementing the same interface, you can use them interchangeably, leading to a more cohesive and predictable codebase.

**3. Ease of Extension:** If you need to add new types of cars in the future, you can easily create additional classes that implement the existing ICar interface. This extension doesnâ€™t require changes to existing code that uses the interface.

**4. Testing and Mocking:** Interfaces make it easier to write unit tests and use mocking frameworks. When you do unit testing, will find the benefits of using interfaces.

**5. Enforces Contract:** It forces you to use all the features of an interface.

**6. Makes your system loosely coupled.**
