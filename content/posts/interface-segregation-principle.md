![what is Interface Segregation Principle?](/images/ISP.jpg)

ðŸ“¢ Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

In simpler terms, this principle suggests that an interface should not include methods that implementing classes donâ€™t need. It Encourages us to create smaller interfaces over the big fat interface.

- [Open Closed Principle](/posts/open-closed-principle/)
- [Liskov Substitution Problem](/posts/liskov-substitution-principle/)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](/posts/dependency-inversion-principle/)

## Violating example

Imagine you have an interface for workers in a company:

```cs
public interface IWorker
{
  void Work();
  void Eat();
  void Sleep();
}

public class Robot : IWorker
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Robot is working.");
    }

    public void Eat()
    {
        // Robots don't eat, so this method is unnecessary for this class
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public void Sleep()
    {
        // Robots don't sleep, so this method is unnecessary for this class
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

}

public class HumanWorker : IWorker
{
    public void Work() => Console.WriteLine("Human is working.");

    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Human is eating.");

    public void Sleep() => Console.WriteLine("Human is sleeping.");

}
```

In this example, `IWorker` interface forces the `Robot` class to implement methods (`Eat` and `Sleep`). But robot does not need to have these functionalities. It is violating the ISP because **Robot** is forced to use **Eat()** and **Sleep()** methods.

## Corrected Example

Now, letâ€™s refactor this design to adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle:

```cs
public interface IWorkable
{
    void Work();
}

public interface IFeedable
{
    void Eat();
}

public interface ISleepable
{
    void Sleep();
}

public class Robot : IWorkable
{
    public void Work() => Console.WriteLine("Robot is working.");
}

public class HumanWorker : IWorkable, IFeedable, ISleepable
{
    public void Work() => Console.WriteLine("Human is working.");

    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Human is eating.");

    public void Sleep() => Console.WriteLine("Human is sleeping.");
}
```

In the refactored example, we have split the `IWorker` interface into three smaller interfaces: `IWorkable`, `IFeedable`, and `ISleepable`. Each class is free to choose the interface it needs. Now, the `Robot` class have to implement `IWorkable` interface only. While the `HumanWorker` class implements all three interfaces.

By splitting interfaces into more specific ones, we adhere to the **Interface Segregation Principle**, making the code more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors.
