## Table structure and total records

Let's look at our table structure as shown in the left panel of the picture

![book_structure](/images/total_number_of_books.jpg)

**Note:** There is a `non-clustered index` on the `Title` column of the `Book` table, which has a total of 1 million records.

```sql
select
  Id,
  Title,
  Author,
  Price
from Book where title='The Divine Comedy'
```

![query_execution_plan](/images/need_for_covering_index.jpg)

As you have noticed in the execution plan, there is a key lookup. Since index is only available for the `Title` column, `Title` is retrieved from the non-clustered index. However, other columns like `Id`, `Author` and `Price` are not present in the non-clustered index, so they will be retrieved from the clustered index (the `Book` table). This results in an additional `key lookup` step and may decrease the performance. It's like, you are looking for records in two places (non clustered index and clustered index).

It might be easier to understand with picture:

![key_lookup_book](/images/key_lookup_book.png)

First, I am going to drop the existing index of `Title` column.

```sql
drop index if exists IX_Book_Title on Book
```

Let's include those columns with the `Title`

```sql
create index IX_Book_Title_Inc_Id_Author_Price
on Book(Title)
include (Id,Author,Price)
```

In this step, we have created a `Covering Index`.

Let's execute this query again:

```sql
select
  Id,
  Title,
  Author,
  Price
from Book where title='The Divine Comedy'
```

Execution plan:

![with_covering_index](/images/with_covering_index.jpg)

Now, the `Key lookup` is gone. All the queried columns are present in the `non-clustered` index.

## Downsides

- It takes additional space to include those columns.
- Decreases the write performance. If your application is write heavy then re-consider it.
