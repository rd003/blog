![dotnet core apps for OpenApi with Scalar](/images/open_api_thumb.png)

`SwaggerUI`, which was previously bundled with .NET Core APIs, has been dropped in .NET 9. However, .NET Core Web APIs still support generating `OpenAPI` documents. .NET Core apps have built-in support for generating information about endpoints and it uses `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` package for that. To configure interactive UIs for these OpenAPI documents, we have several options. We are going to explore these two:

1. Swashbuckle SwaggerUI
2. Scalar

### Create a new project, if does not have an existing

Execute these commands in a sequence

```bash
dotnet new sln -o DotnetOpenApiDemo
cd DotnetOpenApiDemo
dotnet new webapi -n OpenApiDemo.Api
dotnet sln add .\OpenApiDemo.Api\

## command to open the folder in the vs code, skip the step if you use other IDE/editor
code .
```

Now, this project is opened in the vs code. If you use other IDE/Editor then open it there.

I have cleaned up some boilerplate from the Program.cs and make it look like this.

```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddOpenApi();

var app = builder.Build();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.Run();

```

## Adding some endpoints

```cs
app.MapPost("/api/people", () =>
{
    return Results.Ok("Resource is created");
});

app.MapPut("/api/people", () =>
{
    return Results.Ok("Resource is updated");
});

app.MapDelete("/api/people/{id}", (int id) =>
{
    return Results.Ok($"Resource with id:{id} is deleted");
});
```

### Option 1: Using the Swashbuckle SwaggerUi

Install this package:

```bash
 dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUi
```

Add this line in the `Program.cs`

```cs {hl_lines=["5-8"]}
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();

    app.UseSwaggerUI(options =>
    {
        options.SwaggerEndpoint("/openapi/v1.json", "v1");
    });
}
```

Open the `Properties/launchsettings.json` and go to the `https` section

- Set `launchBrowser` to `true`
- Add a property `launchUrl` and set it's value to `swagger`

Your code should look like this:

```json {hl_lines=["4-5"]}
   "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "swagger",
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7241;http://localhost:5008",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
```

Now run the project as shown below:

Our old buddy swagger ui is back

## Option 2: Using Scalar

Install this package:

```bash
 dotnet add package Scalar.AspNetCore
```

Add this line `app.MapScalarApiReference();` in the `Program.cs`

```cs {hl_lines=[4]}
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
    app.MapScalarApiReference();
}
```

Open the `Properties/launchsettings.json` and go to the `https` section

- Set `launchBrowser` to `true`
- Add a property `launchUrl` and set it's value to `scalar/v1`

Your code should look like this:

```json {hl_lines=[4,5]}
   "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "scalar/v1",
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7241;http://localhost:5008",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
```

Now run the project and play around scalar.
