![Sargable queries](/images/1_5lTNjjjTHX1VRCAZG0QFqQ.png)

A query is **SARGable (Search ARGument able)** if a database engine can take advantage of index.

## What makes a query non SARGable?

These are the few factors that makes a query non sargable.

### 1. Put a column inside a function in the whereÂ clause.

```sql
select
 s.SalesOrderID,
 s.SalesPersonID,
 s.OrderDate,
 s.SalesOrderNumber
from Sales.SalesOrderHeader s
where YEAR(s.OrderDate) = 2011; -- Row Retrieved: 1607 and Row read : 31465
```

**Note:** I have created covering index on the `OrderDate`:

```cs
create nonclustered index IX_Sale_OrderDate on Sales.SalesOrderHeader(OrderDate)
include
(
 SalesOrderID,
 SalesPersonID,
 SalesOrderNumber
);
```

Letâ€™s look at the execution plan:

![blah blah](/images/1_Nylldu0zjFXf7uBnxiv18A.jpg)

There are total of 1607 rows for year 2011, but total number of row reads are 31465. Let me explain what happened here. The `OrderDate` has a non-clustered index but database engine won't optimize it and this query is going to read all the rows from the table. Because, `YEAR` function will evaluate against each row that causes the **non clustered index scan** (scan a whole index which have all the needed columns because of covering index). If you don't understand scans and seeks, I would refer you to check [this article](https://medium.com/codex/sql-server-table-scan-clustered-index-scan-index-seek-rid-lookup-key-lookup-d809c6cb2ef3 "https://medium.com/codex/sql-server-table-scan-clustered-index-scan-index-seek-rid-lookup-key-lookup-d809c6cb2ef3").

We can re-write the query to optimize the index on `OrderDate`.

```sql
select
 s.SalesOrderID,
 s.SalesPersonID,
 s.OrderDate,
 s.SalesOrderNumber
from Sales.SalesOrderHeader s
where s.OrderDate>= '2011-01-01' and s.OrderDate<='2011-12-31'; -- rows retrieved 1607 and row read: 1607
```

![bb2](/images/1_dcftSQZh5b1zvPt-BB3HFA.jpg)

Now this query is optimizing the index.

---

### **2. Using the leading wildcards in the LIKEÂ keyword**

```sql
SELECT
 b.*
FROM Book b
WHERE b.Title Like '%fairy%';
```

![img](/images/1_Zk55nbZOFQ45fRALOPHN-g.jpg)

The query defined above wonâ€™t use the index which is defined on the column **â€˜Titleâ€™**. It performs an â€˜index scanâ€™ and read all the rows. Because, we need to scan all the rows where a title contains a string â€˜fairyâ€™.

Letâ€™s re-write the query:

```sql
SELECT
 b.*
FROM Book b
WHERE b.Title Like 'fairy%';
```

![img](/images/1_I39no4yEnegRyBa-4A7N7g.jpg)

This query uses the index and read only appropriate rows. Since the **â€˜Bookâ€™** table have only 1 record which starts with title â€˜fairyâ€™, so it will **read only 1 row**.

---

### 3. Implicit conversions (in the tableÂ side)

When we compare two values with different data types, the sql server converts the [lower-precedence data type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-type-precedence-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15 "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-type-precedence-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15") to higher-precedence data type. Letâ€™s look at the example below (which I have taken from the article [mssqltips](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/6207/sql-server-implicit-conversions-performance-issues/ "https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/6207/sql-server-implicit-conversions-performance-issues/") and I am using AdventureWorks2022 database).

```sql
-- Note: `CardNumber` is `nvarchar`, there is an index on the `CardNumber`
-- and we are comparing it with an integer 11119775847802
SELECT
 CreditCardID,
 CardNumber
FROM Sales.CreditCard
WHERE CardNumber = 11119775847802;
```

![img](/images/1_YoTvtpeuU1k3EPhJfK_m5A.jpg)

Here `CardNumber` is a type of `nvarchar` and we are comparing it with an `integer`. `CardNumber` has an index. There is only one record with CardNumber=11119775847802, so it should read only 1 row to fetch the record. But that won't happen. Sql server database engine reads all the rows to find this record. You wonder why? Ok let me explain.

`CardNumber` is a `nvarchar` type, we are searching for record with `CardNumber = 11119775847802` which is an integer type. Instead of converting `11119775847802` to the `nvarchar`, the SQL Server converts all `CardNumber` rows to an integer, leading to index scan. Are you getting the problem here. We just need a single record, whose `CardNumber` is `**11119775847802**`, for that the whole table is being scanned.

So, use `â€˜11119775847802â€™`instead of `11119775847802`Â , which avoids implicit conversion in a table side, as shown below:

```sql
SELECT
 CreditCardID,
 CardNumber
FROM Sales.CreditCard
WHERE CardNumber = '11119775847802';
```

![img](/images/1_jnvaneScfB2rNsC2ZdL4Yg.jpg)

This query will read 1 row only and use the index effectively.

**Note:** Sometimes sql server smartly handles the implicit conversion and avoid conversion in the table side, like in this example:

```sql
SELECT
 soh.SalesOrderID,
 soh.SalesOrderNumber,
 soh.ModifiedDate
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
WHERE soh.SalesOrderID= '43668';
```

The query above wonâ€™t perform an implicit conversion on the table side. Rather than converting all `SalesOrderId` to `nvarchar`, it just have converted **'43668'** to `integer`.

I have tested various queries, where I am comparing the string values (eg. â€˜43668â€™) to an integer type columns (eg. **SalesOrderID**). What I found is, sql server handles it very well and converts the comparing value not all the rows. That causes the index seek.

So, sometimes sql optimizer also optimize things.

### 4. Using optional parameter `(where column_name=@some_parameter or @some_parameter isÂ NULL)`

I am the victim of this one. I have been doing this for my entire life whenever I was writing raw sql queries (however I have used EF most of the time). And I was not even aware that it is not a good query.

Letâ€™s look at the exampleÂ :

```sql
create or alter procedure GetBooks
 @SearchTerm nvarchar(40)=null
as
begin
 set nocount on;

    select * from Book
    where  @SearchTerm is null or Title like @SearchTerm+'%';

end
go

-- execute the procedure
exec GetBooks @SearchTerm='The Epic Of Gilgamesh'; -- returns 1 row
```

![some_image](/images/1_GdTMU1KfkJcCZ4Tmli8RQw.jpg)

The above query wont use the index on `Title` and end up in `index scan` (scanning all the rows).

We can solve it in two ways:

#### (i). Using dynamic sql

```sql
create or alter procedure GetBooks
 @SearchTerm nvarchar(40)=null
as
begin

set nocount on;

declare @SQL nvarchar(max);

set @SQL = N'SELECT * FROM Book WHERE 1 = 1';

if @SearchTerm is not null
 begin
 set @SearchTerm = @SearchTerm+'%';
 set @SQL += N' AND Title LIKE @SearchTerm';
 end

exec sp_executesql @SQL, N'@SearchTerm nvarchar(40)', @SearchTerm;
end
go

-- Executing the procedure

exec GetBooks @SearchTerm='The Epic Of Gilgamesh'; -- return 1 row
```

![some_img](/images/1_fz9RhHtC43umaMnKzIu7Pw.jpg)

#### (ii). Using OPTION (RECOMPILE)

```sql
create or alter procedure GetBooks
 @SearchTerm nvarchar(40)=null
as
begin
 set nocount on;

select * from Book
 where @SearchTerm is null or Title like @SearchTerm+'%'
 option (RECOMPILE);
end

-- executing the procedure
exec GetBooks @SearchTerm='The Epic Of Gilgamesh'; -- returns 1 row
```

![some_img](/images/1_3AFEP-vl0xpcP1QQS4vRtA.jpg)

`RECOMPILE` causes increased CPU usage. In the most cases it won't be a huge problem. If it is then consider using dynamic sql. But first look for the RECOMPILE. If a query has long compilation time and it runs frequently then consider dynamic sql. It is explained in depth by [Gail](https://www.sqlinthewild.co.za/index.php/2018/03/13/revisiting-catch-all-queries/ "https://www.sqlinthewild.co.za/index.php/2018/03/13/revisiting-catch-all-queries/"), check it out, it has an amazing depth.

### 5. Using OR In where conditions

```sql
SELECT
 SalesOrderID,
 OrderDate,
 SalesOrderNumber,
 CustomerID
FROM
Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE
 CustomerID= 29642
 OR
 OrderDate < '2011-10-31';
```

In the table `Sales.SalesOrderHeader`, the column `CustomerId` has a primary key. And I have defined convering index On `OrderDate (SalesOrderID, CustomerID)`.

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_SalesOrderHeader_OrderDate_Covering
ON Sales.SalesOrderHeader (OrderDate)
INCLUDE (SalesOrderID, CustomerID)
```

Execution plan:

![some_img](/images/1_jgfOpaHXO4wbb3yvWN1FVA.jpg)

This query looks for two different conditions and end up in index scan.

ğŸ‘‰ One solution is to use `FORCESEEK` hint as mentioned [here](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/275352/sql-server-index-scan-when-using-or-operator "https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/275352/sql-server-index-scan-when-using-or-operator"):

```sql
SELECT
 SalesOrderID,
 OrderDate,
 SalesOrderNumber,
 CustomerID
FROM
Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WITH (FORCESEEK)
WHERE
 CustomerID= 29642
 OR
 OrderDate < '2011-10-31';
```

![some_img](/images/1_HPskKtY5v_E-gwbEmMctgA.jpg)

ğŸ‘‰ Another solution is to use union:

```sql
SELECT
 SalesOrderID,
 OrderDate,
 SalesOrderNumber,
 CustomerID
FROM
Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE CustomerID= 29642

UNION

SELECT
 SalesOrderID,
 OrderDate,
 SalesOrderNumber,
 CustomerID
FROM
Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE OrderDate < '2011-10-31';
```

## One moreÂ thing

It is not exactly related to the index but it is related to performance. Do not use OR with JOIN. Iâ€™ve personally never encountered this situation but I found it [here](https://sqlnuggets.com/performance-problem-when-using-or-in-a-join/ "https://sqlnuggets.com/performance-problem-when-using-or-in-a-join/") during the research for this article. I have simulated the situation and presented it to you.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount, o.status
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.id = o.customer_id
OR c.email = o.customer_email
```

Execution plan:

![some_img](/images/1_3oXA4Nm2SlJhPo5fZ4UVIA.jpg)

Statistics:

![some_img](/images/1_gboKCEyiT_239WxFGPBb9g.jpg)

This query took considerable amount of time to run. Even I have only 10k records in each table.

We can use union to tackle the situation.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount, o.status
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id

UNION

SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount, o.status
FROM customers c
left JOIN orders o ON c.email = o.customer_email
```

![some_img](/images/1_lumttaLXJZJdk6cBl4qi_w.jpg)

This query took less time and logical reads.

## Summary

Any of these points do not always scan the table. This only happens when you have large data set (I am talking about thousands of records). Sql server optimizer is smart enough to optimize a query (thats why it is hired). But it is always good to follow these things.

If we sum up, donâ€™t do this:

- where some_function(some_column)= some_value.
- where some_column like %search_string%
- where some_nvarchar_column= integer_value
- where column_name=@some_parameter or @some_parameter is NULL
- where condition1 OR condition2;
