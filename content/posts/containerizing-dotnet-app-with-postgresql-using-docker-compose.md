![Containerizing A¬†.NET App With Postgres Using Docker Compose](/images/1_L8Rtngz25d4SLhLZR7liaA.png)

In this tutorial, we are going to **containerize the¬†.NET Web API application with docker and postgres**. I am assuming you are familiar with docker. At least, you should have some understandings of how docker works. However, I have covered all the steps needed to create a docker container for your application, but I am not going to cover the [theoretical concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29) of docker.

### üî®Tools needed

- Visual Studio Code (Free)
- .Net 9.0 SDK (Free)
- Docker desktop (Free)

### üßë‚ÄçüíªTech used

- .Net 9.0 Web APIs (controller APIs)
- Postgres (within a container)
- Docker compose

**üçµNote:** I have tested it in windows 11 and linux mint xia.

### Why to chose docker¬†compose?

General workflow of creating images and container **without docker compose**:

![without docker](/images/1_EtvCLfmbqtDaMG1qviQ9Rw.png)

You have to create and run containers separately, which involves typing all the commands manually in the terminal or bash each time.

### With docker¬†compose

![using docker image](/images/1_c2bk8tqIsRXfjx9NiPEtuA.png)

All the steps to build the images and create the containers are defined in a a single file called `compose.yml`¬†. You just need to fire a single command to create and run multiple containers.

### Let‚Äôs start with pulling the Github¬†repo

To save time, I have already created an application. You can pull the source code from my Github repo. Execute these commands one by one

```cs
git clone https://github.com/rd003/DotnetApiPostgres.git

code DotnetApiPostgres
```

At this point, your application must have opened in the visual studio code.

### Creating a Dockerfile

First and foremost, create a file named **‚ÄòDockerfile‚Äô** in the root directory. Make sure, **Dockerfile** does not have any extension.

![dockerfile](/images/1_jmPUFggtbIG3WyKITNx67Q.jpg)

A **dockerfile** in the root directory

Add the following content in the docker file.

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
WORKDIR /source

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.sln .
COPY DotnetApiPostgres.Api/*.csproj ./DotnetApiPostgres.Api/
RUN dotnet restore

# copy everything else and build app
COPY DotnetApiPostgres.Api/. ./DotnetApiPostgres.Api/
WORKDIR /source/DotnetApiPostgres.Api
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app

# final stage/image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0 AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "DotnetApiPostgres.Api.dll"]
```

This **Dockerfile** contains the instruction to create a docker image of our¬†.net application. It is needed to build a¬†.net application image, which will run in a container.

### Creating a compose.yml file

Next, create a file name `compose.yml` in the root directory and paste the following content there.

```yml
services:
  web_api:
    container_name: person_api_app
    build: .
    image: people-api:1.0.0
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
        restart: true
  db:
    image: postgres
    container_name: postgres_db
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: p@55w0rd
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres" ]
      interval: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s
      timeout: 10s
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

In this file, we have defined two services.

- First, it will build a docker image of¬†.net application and create a container for it, which will listen on the port 8080
- Second, it will pull the postgres image from the docker hub, create the container for it which will listen in the port 5432. The image will be pulled only once; if you already have a postgres image, it won‚Äôt be pull again.

In the service named `web_api` , I have defined a a property or key named `depends_on` with the value `db` . It means `web_api` service is depends on the service `db` . `web_api` will wait until `db` is up and running before starting.

Service order will be:

- db
- web_api

I have one more property condition: `service_healthy` . It will do health check for the postgres data. `web_api` service won‚Äôt be created until health check of db is marked as healthy. We are basically checking, whether the postgres is running or not.

You also have noticed, I have defined a `volume` with name `postgres_data` in `Volumes` section. I have linked this volume with my `db` service and bind the path `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to it. By doing so, our database has become persistent. If we delete the postgeress container, our database and all of its data still persists.

**Note:** The `dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` file is created at `June,20,2025`. The content present in `dockerfile` and `compose file` is **valid as of now**, but may not be valid if you are reading this blog post in distant future.

### Move Connectionstring

Since container runs the published version of¬†.net applcation, so you need to define connection string in the **appsettings.json**. In this application, the connection string is defined in the **appsettings.development.json.** Remove the connection string from the **appsettings.development.json** and add the connection string to the **appsettings.json**. Connection string should look like as follows.

```cs
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "default": "Host=db;Port=5432;Database=PersonDb;Username=postgres;Password=p@55w0rd"
  }
```

You may have noticed, I have defined `Host` as `db`. Which is the name of the service defined in the `compose.yaml`.

#### Run docker¬†compose

We need to run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`-d` flag indicates that container is running in the detached mode. This command will execute the `compose.yml` file and create the container for the¬†.net application and postgres.

As a result of the command, you should see something like this in your terminal:

![docker comose up¬†-d](/images/1_OwzIi18MQT0EQlI9gBSGEQ.jpg)

To verify if container is running or not, run the following command:

```sh
docker ps -a
```

As a result, you should see the containers you have created.

However you can also check it in the docker desktop.

## Testing the application

Our application is running at : `http://localhost:8080`

To test the application open the browser and test this `GET` endpoint `http://localhost:8080/api/people`

## Stop the composed container

```bash
docker compose down
```

### üíª Code with Dockerfile and compose.yaml

I have created a separate branch which contains the **dockerfile** and **compose.yml** file. To get the source code with these file, you need to checkout the branch `container`¬†.
