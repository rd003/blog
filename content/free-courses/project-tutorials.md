### 1. [Ecommerce app for books](https://youtu.be/_NzPJSofid8)

This is a basic ecommerse app for selling books. I consider this video as one of my best, in the terms of what it offers. It is 5 hrs 47 min long video, divided in good amount of chapters(timestamps). It offers a lot, except payment gateway. It will be good learning experience for a Beginner. I refined and re-uploaded this video at 5-march-2025. Previously it was built on .NET 7 but now it is upgraded to .NET 9.
